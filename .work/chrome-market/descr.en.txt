Click the extension button to play awesome 8-bit chiptune music. Click again to stop.
That's it.

This extension just streams music from keygenmusic.tk (collection of chiptune music from keygens).
Music is absolutely free and legal. Visit keygenmusic.tk for details.

The idea of the extension is simplicity. One button UI.
Click on the icon to start. Click again to stop.
Each time you click the icon, an extension is shuffling playlist.
It is like a radio. You never know the next track.
At the moment, there are more than 6 days of non-stop music ðŸ˜±

Tip:
- Hover cursor over the extension button when music stopped. You'll see Total Played statistic.
