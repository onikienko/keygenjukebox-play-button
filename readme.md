The idea of extension is simplicity. One button UI.  
Click on the icon to start. Click again to stop.  
Each time you click the icon, an extension is shuffling playlist.  
It is like a radio. You never know the next track.  
At the moment, there are more than 6 days of non-stop playing :scream:

**Tips:**  

- Double-click on the extension icon for next track.
- Hover over extension icon to see Total played statistics (when stopped). When playing, you will see track title.

**Manifest V3**

In the `mv3` folder located modern manifest v3 implementation.

**Firefox versions dev. notes**

In the `firefox` folder located an obsolete extension. Version implemented with webExtensions API is located under
the `firefox-webExtensions` folder.

In fact, this `firefox-webExtensions` is slightly modified `chromium` version (only `manifest.json` is different).
